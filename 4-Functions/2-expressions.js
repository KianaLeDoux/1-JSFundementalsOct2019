// Expressions
// setting a variable to be  function and assigning it a variable name. 

let hey = function hi () {
    console.log('hi'); // this is declaring a function, we simply give it a variable name. The variable name hey is representive of the variable 'hi';
}

// difference between a declaration and an expression is that declarations get hoisted and expressions do not.
