//* Comparison Operators are used to compare values to another
//*Equal 
'3' == 3;

// strictly equal
3 === 3; // best practice is to use tripple equal sign

// Not equal

3!=4;
console.log(3 != 4);

// We can also check if something is strictly not equal.
'3' !== 3; // strings have quotes around them, the string can have the same value as a number. They're different data types.
 
// Greater than or less than 
3 > 2; // 3 is greater than 2

// Less than
2 < 3;

// Greater than or equal to - greater than sign comes first then check if their equal to each other
3 >= 2;

// Less than or equal to
2 <= 3;

// Check if something is divisiable by both, and vs and
 2 && 3;

 // Or
 2 || 3; // or
